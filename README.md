# Godot Logging Util

![](icon.png)

A logging util for Godot Engine 3.0

## Features

- Print detailed logs.
- Write to log files.
- Supports use of multiple log files.


## How to use

## Add to Global Autoload
Select Project -> Project Settings, and choose the AutoLoad tab.  
Select the `logger.gd` script, and give it a good name.
> Recommend you use the name **Logger** as the global variable.


## Preparing the Logger
By default we expect the script name to be used as the argument for the `get_logger` method.

```
var Log = Logger.get_logger("script_name_goes_here.gd")
```

This will prepare a default `FileWriter` that will write the logs to a file found in `user://` directory. This behavior can be overridden by adding additional information, such as this:

```
var Log = Logger.get_logger("script_name_goes_here.gd", "res://", "custom_log_name")
```

This will write the logs used by the `Log` object in your `res://` folder, with the name `custom_log_name`. Each log has a date set on it, so the full name would appear something such as `res://2019-06-10-custom_log_name.log`.

## How to use it

There are four kinds of logs.
- info
- debug
- warn
- error

For example, using the info log level:

```python
var Log = Logger.get_logger("script_name_goes_here.gd")

func _ready():
	Log.info("Starting the game!", "_ready func")
```

Which will output the following (*with a different time stamp, of course*):

```
[2019.06.10 8:32:44] | INFO  | [script_name_goes_here.gd] [_ready func] >> Starting the game!
```

The same printed line will also be found in the default log path: 
`user://2019-06-10-logger.log`.
> on windows it can by default be found in `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\<your-app>\`

## Example

### example.gd script:

```python
extends Node

# Logging
var Log = Logger.get_logger("example.gd", "res://", "example-logs")

func _ready():
	Log.start("_ready()") # now we wont have to specify function name in the other log statements

	Log.info("Starting the game")

	Log.debug("Debug information about values and such")
	# Do some work here
	# ...

	Log.warn("User forgot to configure something. Falling back to default values. :C ")

	# Critical error that prevents the application to function!
	Log.error("Unable to retrieve the cheese from the mouse!")

	# Specify the end of the use of the default function name. 
	# This can also be done by setting the function name in the 
	# next method,without the use of the end() function in the Log.
	Log.end()
```

### Output (with default formatting)

```
[2018.04.15 12:57:47] | INFO  | [example.gd] [_ready()] >> Starting the game
[2018.04.15 12:57:47] | DEBUG | [example.gd] [_ready()] >> Debug information about values and such
[2018.04.15 12:57:47] | WARN  | [example.gd] [_ready()] >> User forgot to configure something. Falling back to default values. :C 
[2018.04.15 12:57:47] | ERROR | [example.gd] [_ready()] >> Unable to retrieve the cheese from the mouse!
```

Identical output in the log file. If the log file exists, we will append logs to it. 
Every day a different log file will be used, since we are using a time stamp in the file name.
